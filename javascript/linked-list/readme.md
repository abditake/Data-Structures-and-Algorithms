# Singly Linked List
A linked list is a data structure where the objects are arranged 
in a linear order. Unlike an array, however, in which the linear 
order is determined by the array indices, the order in a linked 
list is determined by a pointer in each object.  

## Challenge
kth from end
  - argument: a number, k, as a parameter.
  - Return the nodeâ€™s value that is k places from the tail of the linked list.
  - You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.
## Approach & Efficiency
Used node to make sure the methods were outputting the correct results

## API
